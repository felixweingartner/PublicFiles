Hello sir/madam,

This project is for the desktop programming category - FBLA.
The user interface should be simple to navigate, but instructions are provided in the help window.
The project was created using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise, and no templates were used.  The project code can be located as pdf files in the folder.
Note that all information is saved on a Microsoft Sql Server Database, so internet connection is required to save and edit information.

If you are familiar with MS Sql Server and would like to connect to it, here are the credentials: (ignore the quotes)
DataSource = "mssql3.gear.host"
UserID = "phoenix"
Password = "quido#"
//If you are not familiar but would like to connect to the server, download the Microsoft Sql Managment Studio at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=840946, open the application, enter in the credentials I provided above, and then click on "phoenix', then 'tables', and there you will see all the database tables.  This is not required to test the application, but if you choose to do this, please avoid changing any configurations and only examine the database tables associated with the project.  This server is being used for other things.  If you have any questions on this, feel free to contact me.

System Requirements:
Best bet is to run on Windows 8 or Windows 10, but Windows 7 should work as well.
Have at least 65 mb of RAM availiable
A processor capable of running a web browser should be sufficient enough ;)
I won't mention gpu because this is not a game ;)
An internet connection, if you are getting problems with saving data, your firewall might be blocking the app
If the app will not run at all, the most likely reason would be your version of .NET is too old.  To download the latest .NET, go to https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=49981

To Run the app:
Open the FEC_Project_Weingartner folder
run the FEC.application file, then click install.  The setup file should work too, they seem to do the same thing.  This should just run the program and and will not install anything on your machine.  To completley remove the application, just close and delete the project folder.

If you have any questions or comments, please please please contact me ;).  You can reach me by email: felix.weingartner@suusuccess.org or by phone (435) 592-3071.  Have fun with the application :}
